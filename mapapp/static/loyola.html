<p>Loyola College, Chennai is a prestigious autonomous arts and science college founded in 1925 by the Jesuits, located in Nungambakkam, Chennai. Though affiliated with the University of Madras, it has had autonomy since 1978, allowing it to frame its own curriculum and evaluation system. The college offers a wide array of undergraduate, postgraduate, M.Phil., and Ph.D. programs in disciplines spanning arts, science, and commerce, and is known for strong research credentialsâ€”being recognized as a Scientific & Industrial Research Organization (SIRO) by the Government of India. It is also blessed with excellent facilities: a large, well-stocked library, separate hostels for men and women, extensive infrastructure for labs and extracurriculars, and support services for differently-abled students. Loyola is consistently highly ranked among colleges in India, has NAAC accreditation, and is notable for combining rigorous academics with strong values of social service, outreach, and holistic development of students.</p>
